# Cross-chain Token Management

The dual-chain architecture of KRYZA Diamond & KRYZA Diamond empowers you to build your own decentralized apps while also taking advantage of the fast trading performance offered on KRD DEX (decentralized exchange). The native cross-chain communication mechanism allows tokens to be transferred between BC and KRD easily.

KRYZA Diamond and KRYZA Diamond work together to ensure that one token can circulate in both formats with confirmed total supply and be used in different use cases.
