# KRYZA Diamond

## What is KRYZA Diamond?

KRYZA Diamond brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with KRYZA Diamond using an innovative consensus of [Proof of Authority(PoA)](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md)

## Why is KRYZA Diamond designed as a separate chain from KRYZA Diamond?

The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. Even if that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of KRYZA Diamond. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

## How does KRYZA Diamond work? What is the architecture and consensus used?

KRYZA Diamond relies on a system with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.

There will be fewer validators on KRYZA Diamond testnet.

## What are the benefits for developers to build on KRYZA Diamond?

* EVM-compatible: KRYZA Diamond supports all the existing Ethereum tooling
Fast block time, cheaper cost
* Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: KRD DEX remains a liquid venue of exchange of assets on KRYZA Diamond and KRYZA Diamond"

## What are the benefits for developers to build on KRYZA Diamond?

KRYZA Diamond opens the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading

## What make KRYZA Diamond different?

Key Innovations:

* Proof-of-authority Consensus

* Native Cross-Chain Communication

* Expand the use cases of KRD token

## KRYZA Diamond is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?

EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to KRYZA Diamond.

## Can developers make hybrid Dapps using both KRYZA Diamond and KRYZA Diamond in one single Dapp?

Yes, with the help of native cross-chain functions
